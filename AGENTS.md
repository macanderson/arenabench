# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repository.
ArenaBench is a Python (uv) project — the benchmark arena core
(`arenabench/`), recorder, web app, and UI, plus infra and match
tooling. `make help` lists the entry points; `README.md` is the
authoritative source for the details.

## Standing decisions — apply without asking

Each directive below is a Steering Context Record in [`docs/scr/`](docs/scr/);
the SCR is canonical — it carries the rationale, exceptions, and enforcement
status. This block is the compiled summary that every agent — Claude Code
(via CLAUDE.md's `@AGENTS.md` import) and Stella (which reads AGENTS.md
directly) — loads at session start. The corpus is identical across the
macanderson org repos.

- **[SCR-001](docs/scr/SCR-001-no-full-suite-builds.md) — Tests/builds
  (inner loop):** Never compile or run the full test suite while developing.
  Build and test only the crates/packages/modules touched by the change
  (plus direct dependents on interface changes). The full suite is CI's job.
  Here: `uv run pytest tests/test_x.py -q`, never bare `pytest` or `make test`.
- **[SCR-002](docs/scr/SCR-002-durability-first-architecture.md) —
  Architecture decisions:** Do not ask. Choose the most durable option — the
  one that can't be questioned in 10 years as the right move. Cheap-and-easy
  only wins when it is also the excellent durable choice. Record every such
  decision as an ADR in `docs/adr/`; the ADR replaces the question.
- **[SCR-003](docs/scr/SCR-003-dod-verified-close.md) — Definition of
  done:** An issue closes only when every DoD checklist item is satisfied
  and verified. Reference-grade includes tests, code comments, docs, and
  CI — not just the implementation. A PR that advances an issue without
  finishing it links it with `Refs #N` rather than `Closes #N`: `Refs`
  does not close, so the merge gate does not hold that PR against the
  issue's DoD. A PR may carry both, and is gated only on what it closes. A
  PR that closes nothing is waived by a label, and which one is a claim:
  `no-issue` for a trivial change, `closes-nothing` for a substantial one
  that closes no issue by design.
- **[SCR-004](docs/scr/SCR-004-residue-becomes-issues.md) — Fix over
  file:** Fix what you notice in the PR you are making; two unrelated fixes
  in one PR is fine. File an issue only when a fix cannot responsibly ride
  the PR (a maintainer decision, a rig or spend, or work larger than the
  session), and only when fixing it moves stability, reliability,
  maintainability, innovation, efficiency, or performance. Apply ONLY the
  `triage` label.
- **[SCR-005](docs/scr/SCR-005-triage-separation-of-duties.md) — Triage
  separation of duties:** Never apply priority (`P0`–`P3`) or size labels —
  a dedicated triage agent owns sizing and priority; a guard workflow
  strips creator-applied priorities.
- **[SCR-006](docs/scr/SCR-006-schema-changes-are-labelled.md) — Schema
  changes and migrations:** A pull request that changes a schema carries
  `migration-required`, and the migration reaches production before or with
  the deploy of that change, never after. Say in the PR which store changed
  and what must be applied. Where a repo has no automation to apply the label
  from the diff, apply it by hand. Do not add an automatic apply to a deploy
  pipeline under this record; that is a separate decision, made per repo.

## Issue fields and reflection

Mac set this on 2026-09-28 for every repository. Every issue in Mac's repositories belongs on the `All issues` project board in the `macanderson` account. The board carries six fields. Keep all six correct on every issue you work on.

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt | Text | The prompt that starts an agent on the work |
| Model Tier | Ultra, Pro, Standard, Lite | The model tier the work needs |
| Size | XS, S, M, L, XL | The size of the change |
| `agent_mins_est` | Number | Agent minutes the work should take |
| `agent_mins` | Number | Agent minutes the work took |
| Resolution | Shipped, Won't ship, Duplicate | How the issue closed |

- **Add the issue to the board when you file it.** Set Prompt, Model Tier, and `agent_mins_est` at the same time. Set Size too, unless a triage rule in this repository gives sizing to the triage agent.
- **Stamp your minutes when your run ends.** Add the minutes your run spent on the issue to `agent_mins`. Add to the value already there, because several runs can share one issue.
- **Write a reflection when your run ends.** Post it as a comment on the issue. Give your run's minutes, say what shipped, compare `agent_mins` with `agent_mins_est`, and say what the next agent should know. The reflections are the record of minutes. If two runs write `agent_mins` at once and one value is lost, rebuild the sum from the reflections.
- **Set Resolution when the issue closes.**
- **Fix any field you find wrong** on any issue you touch.
- **Use the reflection until the board exists.** If `gh project list` shows no `All issues` board, or your token lacks the `project` scope, write the six values in the reflection instead. Copy them to the board once it exists.

These commands find the board and set a field:

```sh
gh project list --owner macanderson                                  # the board titled "All issues"
gh project field-list <number> --owner macanderson --format json     # field and option ids
gh project item-add <number> --owner macanderson --url <issue-url> --format json --jq .id   # the item id
gh project item-edit --project-id <project-id> --id <item-id> --field-id <field-id> --number 42
```
